# astral-rift

The first Autonomous World Template on the Internet Computer. It is meant as a template to help game developers on ICP build their games. All game assets are royalty-free and open-source, and can be used for any purpose under Unity Standard EULA license. Feel free to download the project and modify it however you want. 

The game leverages the World Engine Protocol built by BOOM DAO to store all data on-chain. Feel free to dig into the code to see how we use ICP canister smart contracts for the game server and database. Feel free to deploy your own "World" canister from the BOOM Game Launcher website. Happy coding!
